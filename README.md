<h3>This project aims to build a collaborative space for people to experiment with building mini-synthesizers and getting to jam in real time.</h3>  
It is an exploration of web audio in an attempt to highlight the benefits of this growing area. 

I believe they are: 
<li>
immediacy of access for users</li>
<li>implied connectivity to the Internet. </li>

I am looking for help in three areas: 

1. Dynamic programming to create interfaces that corrospond with a "back-end" synth
2. Creating a node server that can handle multiple users in real time, most likely using socket.io
